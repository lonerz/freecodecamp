# freecodecamp

How long does it actually take to finish FreeCodeCamp? What is the
difficulty of each section? What are some recommended resources
other than the current curriculum?

If you wanted to answer the above questions and more, you've came
to the right place. Not only am I going to try to finish FCC as
quickly and effectively as possible, I will be writing notes,
guides, tips to learn the curriculum efficiently and recording
the amount of time it took me to finish each section. 

I will also be posting code, not for you to copy, but to show
that I have completed the projects and can be used by others
as a guideline that they can use. I really hope that you'll
stick with me through this journey. Star and watch this
repository for updates!
