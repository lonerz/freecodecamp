# Overview 

My approach to finishing FCC's curriculum was to save most of the coding projects till the end.
This meant I would try to finish all the learning of the programming languages before moving
onto the projects. I picked this method for two reasons: it's easier to learn something new
than apply it through a project, and you may be able to use something from a future section
in a previous project, which can save some time. The amount of time taken to learn a new
language and get acclimated to it shouldn't change if you try to learn it now than later.
Thus, this was my approach to FCCâ€“ this doesn't necessarily have to be your approach.
